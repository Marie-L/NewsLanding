# Intro

The news landing [page](https://wellcome.ac.uk/news) of wellcome.ac.uk is being re-designed and I am building a working prototype for one of the new features. I built a new Drupal 8 site to demo it.

This repo serves the purpose of recording the planning process and documenting key milestones of the project.  
- To run it, `cd drupal-vm` 
- run, `vagrant up`
- in the browser, navigate to the url `http://drupalvm.test/`
- click **News Landing Demo Feature**
